# Strict Mode (`'use strict'`)

**Strict Mode** is key for writing safer and more reliable JavaScript.

**Strict Mode** is a way to opt-in to a restricted version of JavaScript. It was introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) to eliminate silent errors, fix mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations, and prohibit some syntax likely to be defined in future ES versions.

Strict Mode = Modern Mode  
Strict Mode X Sloppy Mode (this is not an official term)

## What, Why, and How

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **What is it?** | A directive (`'use strict';`) that enables a safer, stricter subset of JavaScript by changing how code is executed. |
| **Why use it?** | **1. Catches common coding mistakes** as exceptions (e.g., trying to use an undeclared variable) instead of failing silently. **2. Fixes mistakes** that made JavaScript language difficult to optimize. **3. Prohibits** confusing and poorly designed "bad parts" of the language. |
| **How to use it?** | By placing the string literal `'use strict';` at the very beginning of a script or the beginning of a function body. |

## Key Features and Implications (What it Changes)

Strict Mode primarily works by transforming bad practices into explicit errors.

### 1\. Eliminates Global Variable Leaks 🚫

In non-strict mode, assigning to an undeclared variable implicitly creates a global variable. Strict Mode makes this an error.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Non-Strict Mode (without 'use strict'):
function messyFunction() {
    message = "Hello"; // 'message' becomes a global variable
}
messyFunction();
console.log(message); // Output: Hello (No error)

// Strict Mode:
function cleanFunction() {
    'use strict';
    try {
        errorMsg = "Oops"; // ReferenceError: errorMsg is not defined
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Strict Mode Error:", e.name);
    }
}
cleanFunction();
// Output: Strict Mode Error: ReferenceError 
```

### 2\. Disables Default `this` Binding 🎯

As you learned earlier, in non-strict mode, when a function is called without an explicit owner (`simpleFunction()`), `this` defaults to the Global Object (`window`/`global`).

In Strict Mode, **`this` remains `undefined`** in such standalone function calls, preventing accidental modifications to the global scope.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
'use strict';

function logThis() {
    console.log('logThis(): this is', this);
}

logThis(); // Default Binding in Strict Mode
// Output: logThis(): this is undefined 
```

### 3\. Prevents Deleting Variables, Functions, and Arguments 🗑️

Trying to delete simple variable names, functions, or function arguments will throw a `SyntaxError` or `TypeError`.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
'use strict';
let x = 10;

// This will throw a TypeError in strict mode
try {
    delete x;
} catch (e) {
    console.log("Strict Mode Error:", e.name, "— cannot delete variable.");
}
// Output: Strict Mode Error: TypeError — cannot delete variable.
```

### 4\. Prohibits Duplicate Parameter Names 👯

Strict Mode makes it a `SyntaxError` to have two or more parameters with the same name in a function declaration.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// This throws a SyntaxError in strict mode
/*
function sum(a, b, a) { // SyntaxError
    'use strict'; 
    // ...
}
*/
```

### 5\. Restricts `eval` Usage 🤫

Strict Mode prevents variables declared inside an `eval()` call from creating new variables in the surrounding scope. This improves security and predictability.

## How to Apply Strict Mode

You can apply Strict Mode globally or locally:

1. **Entire Script (Global Strict Mode):**  
Put `'use strict';` at the very top of your JavaScript file.

```javascript
'use strict';

// All code in this file is now executed in strict mode.
function foo() { /* ... */ }
// ...
```

2. **Function Level (Local Strict Mode):**  
Put `'use strict';` at the top of a specific function body. This is useful for migrating code gradually.

```javascript
// This code is not in strict mode
function safeFunction() {
    'use strict';
    // Only the code inside this function is in strict mode.
}
// This code is not in strict mode
```

## 💡 Summary / Key Takeaways

| Key Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Directive** | Enabled by the string literal `'use strict';` at the start of a script or function. |
| **Safety First** | It turns many confusing, silent failures into explicit **runtime errors** (e.g., undeclared variables). |
| **Global `this`** | Prevents `this` from defaulting to the Global Object in function calls, making it **`undefined`** instead. |
| **Best Practice** | It's highly recommended to write all new JavaScript code in Strict Mode for better code quality, debuggability, and performance. |
