# Functions as first class citizens in JavaScript

In JavaScript, functions are considered "first-class citizens" because they are treated like any other value (such as numbers, strings, or objects) within the language. This means they possess the following characteristics:

* **Assignable to variables:** Functions can be assigned to variables, object properties, or array elements, just like any other data type.

Example

```JavaScript
const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
};

greet();

// Output
// Hello!
```

* **Passed as arguments to other functions:** Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, enabling the creation of higher-order functions and callback mechanisms.

```JavaScript
function executeFunction(fn) {
    fn();
}

executeFunction(function() {
    console.log("Executing callback!");
});

// Output
// Executing callback!
```

* **Returned from other functions:** Functions can be returned as values from other functions, which is a key concept in closures and functional programming patterns.

```JavaScript
function createMultiplier(factor) {
    return function(number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

const multiplyByTwo = createMultiplier(2);
console.log(multiplyByTwo(5));

// Output
// 10
```

* **Stored in data structures:** Functions can be stored within arrays, objects, or other data structures.

```JavaScript
const operations = {
    add: (a, b) => a + b,
    subtract: (a, b) => a - b
};

console.log(operations.add(10, 5));

// Output
// 15
```

This first-class nature of functions is fundamental to JavaScript's flexibility and power, enabling advanced programming techniques like higher-order functions, functional programming, and more modular and reusable code.
