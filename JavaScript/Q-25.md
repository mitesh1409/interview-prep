# Pure functions

In JavaScript, a pure function adheres to two primary characteristics: 

* **Determinism (Same Input, Same Output):** A pure function will always produce the exact same output when given the exact same input arguments. It does not depend on any external state or mutable data that could change during program execution.
* **No Side Effects:** A pure function does not cause any observable changes outside of its own scope. This means it does not: [2]  
  * Mutate its input arguments.
  * Modify any external variables or global state. 
  * Perform I/O operations (e.g., console logging, network requests, DOM manipulation, file system changes). 

Example of a Pure Function:  

```JavaScript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Always returns 5
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Always returns 5
```

In this example, add is a pure function because:  

* Given the inputs 2 and 3, it will always return 5.
* It does not modify a or b, nor does it affect any other part of the program's state.

Example of an Impure Function:  

```JavaScript
let globalCounter = 0;

function incrementCounter(value) {
  globalCounter += value; // Modifies external state
  return globalCounter;
}

console.log(incrementCounter(5)); // Output depends on previous calls
console.log(incrementCounter(5)); // Output depends on previous calls
```

In this example, incrementCounter is an impure function because:  

* Its output depends on the mutable globalCounter variable, so the same input (5) can yield different outputs.
* It modifies the external globalCounter variable, causing a side effect.

Benefits of Pure Functions:  

* **Predictability:** Easier to reason about and understand, as their behavior is consistent.
* **Testability:** Can be tested in isolation without needing to set up complex external states.
* **Maintainability:** Less prone to introducing bugs due to unexpected side effects.
* **Composability:** Easier to combine and reuse in different parts of an application.
* **Optimization:** Can be optimized by compilers or interpreters due to their deterministic nature (e.g., memoization).

Inbuilt pure functions in JavaScript:  

`Math.abs()`  
Returns the absolute value of a number.

`Math.ceil()`  
Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.

`Math.floor()`  
Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

`Math.max()`  
Returns the maximum value from a set of numbers.

`Math.min()`  
Returns the minimum value from a set of numbers.

`Math.round()`  
Returns the nearest integer to a given number.

`Math.sqrt()`  
Returns the square root of a given number.

`parseInt()`  
Converts a string to an integer.

`parseFloat()`  
Converts a string to a floating point number.

`JSON.parse()`  
Converts a JSON string to a JavaScript object.

`Array.prototype.concat()`  
Returns a new array that contains the elements of the original array plus any additional elements that were passed in as arguments.

`Array.prototype.slice()`  
Returns a new array that contains a portion of the original array, specified by a start and end index.

`Array.prototype.map()`  
Returns a new array that is the result of calling a provided function on each element of the original array.

`Array.prototype.filter()`  
Returns a new array that contains only the elements of the original array that satisfy a provided testing function.

`Array.prototype.reduce()`  
Returns a single value that is the result of applying a provided function to each element of the array.

`String.prototype.toUpperCase()`  
Returns a new string that contains the original string in all uppercase letters.

`String.prototype.toLowerCase()`  
Returns a new string that contains the original string in all lowercase letters.

Inbuilt impure functions in JavaScript:  

`Math.random()`  
Returns a random number between 0 and 1. This function relies on external state which is the current state of the random number generator and its output changes every time it is called.

`Date.now()`  
Returns the current timestamp which is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970. This function relies on external state which is the current time and its output changes every time it is called.

`console.log()`  
Writes a message to the console. It does not return a value but it has a side effect of logging information to the console.

`setTimeout()`  
Executes a function after a specified delay which is specified in milliseconds. This function has a side effect of scheduling a function to be executed in the future.

`setInterval()`  
Executes a function at a specified interval which is specified in milliseconds. This function has a side effect of scheduling a function to be executed repeatedly at a fixed interval.

`document.write()`  
Writes HTML content to the document. It does not return a value but it has a side effect of modifying the document.
