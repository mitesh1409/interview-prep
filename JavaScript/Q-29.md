# Nullish coalescing operator `??`

The nullish coalescing operator (??) in JavaScript is a logical operator that provides a default value for a variable when its left-hand operand is either null or undefined. It returns the right-hand side operand only if the left-hand side operand is strictly null or undefined; otherwise, it returns the left-hand side operand.

Syntax:  
`leftOperand ?? rightOperand`

How it works:  

* If leftOperand is null or undefined, the expression evaluates to rightOperand.
* If leftOperand is any other value (including false, 0, "", or NaN), the expression evaluates to leftOperand.

Key difference from the logical OR operator (||):  
The || operator returns the right-hand side operand if the left-hand side operand is any falsy value (which includes null, undefined, false, 0, "", and NaN). In contrast, ?? is more specific and only considers null and undefined as "nullish" values that trigger the default.

Example:  

```JavaScript
let userName = null;
let defaultName = "Guest";

let displayUserName = userName ?? defaultName; // displayUserName will be "Guest"

let userScore = 0;
let defaultScore = -1;

let finalScore = userScore ?? defaultScore; // finalScore will be 0 (because 0 is not null or undefined)

let userStatus = false;
let defaultStatus = true;

let activeStatus = userStatus ?? defaultStatus; // activeStatus will be false (because false is not null or undefined)
```

When to use it:  
The nullish coalescing operator is particularly useful when you want to provide a default value only when a variable genuinely lacks a value (is null or undefined), but you want to preserve other falsy values like 0, false, or an empty string, as valid and intentional values.
