# Function expression, Function statement, Function Declaration

In JavaScript, "Function Declaration," "Function Expression," and "Function Statement" refer to distinct ways of defining functions, each with specific characteristics.

**Function Declaration (also known as Function Statement):**  
A Function Declaration defines a named function as a standalone statement in the main code flow. It is "hoisted," meaning the function can be called before its actual definition in the code.

```JavaScript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greet("Alice"));

// Output
// Hello, Alice!
```

**Function Expression:**  
A Function Expression defines a function as part of an expression. It can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument, or returned from another function. Function expressions are not hoisted, so they must be defined before they are called. They can be named or anonymous.  

```JavaScript
// Anonymous Function Expression
let sayHi = function(name) {
  return "Hi, " + name + "!";
};

console.log(sayHi("Bob")); // Output: Hi, Bob!

// Named Function Expression (less common, but useful for recursion or debugging)
let factorial = function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
};

console.log(factorial(5));

// Output
// 120
```

Key Differences:  

* **Hoisting:** Function Declarations are hoisted, allowing them to be called before their definition. Function Expressions are not hoisted and must be defined before use.
* **Naming:** Function Declarations are always named. Function Expressions can be anonymous or named.
* **Context:** Function Declarations are standalone statements. Function Expressions are part of a larger expression (e.g., variable assignment).

Function Statement:  
The term "Function Statement" is largely synonymous with "Function Declaration" in JavaScript. It refers to the syntax used to declare a function as a top-level statement in the code.
