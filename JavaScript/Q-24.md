# Higher order functions

A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.

This programming concept allows for greater abstraction and reusability by treating functions as first-class citizens, enabling developers to build more modular and maintainable code.

Common examples include JavaScript's `map()`, `filter()` and `reduce()` methods, which operate on arrays and take a callback function as an argument.

Key characteristics  

* **Accepts functions as arguments:** A higher-order function can take other functions as parameters. The function passed in is often referred to as a "callback function".
  * **Example:** A `sort()` function might take a comparison function as an argument to define how to sort a list of objects.

* **Returns a function:** A higher-order function can also return a new function. This is useful for creating customized functions without rewriting the original code.
  * **Example:** A function called `multiplyBy()` could take a number and return a new function that multiplies its input by that number. 

Why they are useful  

* **Abstraction:** They help abstract over actions, not just values, allowing you to create reusable patterns for common operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.
* **Code Reusability:** By abstracting operations, they make it easier to reuse code and avoid duplication.
* **Modularity and Readability:** They can make code easier to understand and maintain by encapsulating operations in a clear way, although overusing them can lead to complexity.
* **Functional Programming:** They are a fundamental concept in functional programming languages and paradigms, which emphasize functions as the primary building blocks of programs.
