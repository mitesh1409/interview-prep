# Prototype & Prototype Chain

**Prototype** meaning  
A prototype is an early, functional model of a product used to test a concept and gather feedback before final development. It can be as simple as a paper sketch or a basic, clickable digital version, and helps identify flaws and refine the design before investing significant time and resources. Think of it as a working draft or a "rough draft" of an idea to see if it works.
