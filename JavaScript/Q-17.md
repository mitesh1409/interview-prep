# Coding Question

Source: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8EkdjS8IY0Q

What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
function show() {
    {
        var x = 9;
        var y = 10;
    }
    console.log(x, y);
}

show();
```

Follow up questions:

1. Explain why x and y variables are available outside the block.
2. Modify this code so that x and y variables are not available outside the block.
    - use let/const
    - without using let/const

---

Solution:

```javascript
// What is the output of the following code?

function show() {
    {
        var x = 9;
        var y = 10;
    }
    console.log(x, y);
}

show();

/*
Output:
9 10

Here x and y are available outside the block because variable declared with var are not block scoped.
var = Global scoped or Function scoped
let, const = Global scoped, Function scoped or Block scoped
*/

// Modify this code so that x and y don't leak outside the block.
// Using IIFE

function show() {
    (function() {
        var x = 9;
        var y = 10;
    })();

    console.log(x, y);
}

show();

/*
Output:
Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
*/

// Modify this code so that x and y don't leak outside the block.
// Using let/const

function show() {
    {
        let x = 9;
        let y = 10;
    }
    console.log(x, y);
}

show();

/*
Output:
Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
*/
```
