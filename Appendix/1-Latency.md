# Latency

In software, latency is the time delay between a user's action (like a click) and the system's response, often called "lag," measured in milliseconds (ms). It's the time it takes for data to travel from a client to a server and back, influenced by network distance, server processing, software efficiency, and security checks, with low latency meaning faster, smoother application performance, crucial for gaming, video, and data-heavy apps. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Key Aspects of Latency in Software: 

• Definition: The total time for a data packet to complete a round trip (request and response). [1, 2]  
• Measurement: Typically in milliseconds (ms). [1, 2]  
• Causes: 
	• Physical Distance: Longer distances take more time for data to travel. [2, 5]  
	• Network Hops: Every router/switch adds processing delay. [1, 4, 5, 6]  
	• Server Processing: Server capability and data volume affect response time. [3, 7]  
	• Software Inefficiency: Poorly coded or resource-intensive applications. [3]  
	• Security: Firewalls inspecting packets can add latency. [4]  

• Impact: 
	• High Latency (Lag): Slow loading, choppy video, unresponsive interfaces, poor gaming experience. [8, 9, 10, 11]  
	• Low Latency: Fast, seamless user experience, crucial for real-time applications. [3, 8, 9, 12]  

• Examples: A delay when adding an item to an online cart, or stuttering in a video call. [7]
