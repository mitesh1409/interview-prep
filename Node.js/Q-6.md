# What are the 7 main features of Node.js?

## 1. Single Threaded

Node.js operates on a **single thread** for its main execution. This is handled by the **Event Loop**, which processes all client requests sequentially. This simplifies development and avoids deadlocks common in multi-threaded environments. However, it leverages **non-blocking I/O** (via `libuv`) to offload expensive operations, making it highly efficient for handling many concurrent connections.

## 2. Asynchronous

All of Node.js's I/O operations (like reading files, network requests, or database queries) are **asynchronous** and **non-blocking** by default. Instead of waiting for an operation to complete, Node.js immediately moves to the next instruction and uses callbacks, Promises, or `async/await` to handle the result when the operation finishes. This prevents the single thread from being tied up, ensuring high throughput.

## 3. Event Driven

Node.js follows an **Event-Driven Architecture**. It uses the **Event Loop** to continuously monitor for events (like a request arrival, a timer completion, or a file read being finished). When an event occurs, it triggers the corresponding listener function. This model is efficient for handling real-time data and high concurrency.

## 4. V8 JavaScript Engine

Node.js uses the **Google V8 JavaScript engine** (the same one used in Chrome) to execute JavaScript code. V8 compiles JavaScript directly into **native machine code**, making the execution very fast and high-performing.

## 5. Cross-Platform

Node.js can run on various operating systems, including **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. This **cross-platform** compatibility is possible because it wraps the V8 engine and the `libuv` library, abstracting away the differences in the underlying OS.

## 6. NPM (Node Package Manager)

**NPM** is the default package manager for Node.js. It is the **largest ecosystem of open-source libraries** in the world. NPM allows developers to easily install, share, and manage project dependencies and tools, dramatically accelerating development time.

## 7. Real-Time Capabilities

The combination of the single-threaded, event-driven, and non-blocking architecture makes Node.js highly suitable for **Real-Time Applications** (RTAs). This includes chat applications, live updates, collaborative tools, and gaming backends, as it can efficiently maintain open, persistent connections (like WebSockets) with many clients.
