# What are Streams in Node.js?

Streams allow reading/writing data in chunks, rather than all at once,  
which makes them efficient for handling large files or data transfers.

There are four main types of streams in Node.js:

1. Readable: for reading data (e.g., fs.createReadStream()).
2. Writable: for writing data (e.g., fs.createWriteStream()).
3. Duplex: for both reading and writing (e.g., net.Socket).
4. Transform: a type of duplex stream that can modify or transform data as it is read or written (e.g., zlib.createGzip()).
