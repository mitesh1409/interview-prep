# What is Asynchronous programming? Synchronous vs Asynchronous

In programming "Synchronous" means - the code that runs line by line or in sequence.
"Asynchronous" is the opposite of "Synchronous", it means - the code that does not run line by line.

For most tasks in our programs, its possible for our computer/server to work on
the multiple tasks at the same time, when one piece of code is still executing,
our program moves onto the next piece of code, this is "Asynchronous" code execution.

Often times in your program, there will be some "Asynchronous" functions.
These "Asynchronous" functions run in the background while your JavaScript has already
moved onto the next line of code.

**Synchronous vs Asynchronous**  

| | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Order of Execution | Guaranteed (Top -> Bottom) | Not Guaranteed, can run in Parallel |
| Blocks main thread? | Yes | No |

**Synchronous Programming**

1. Multiple tasks are executed in a sequential manner, one after another.
2. Task will have to wait until its previous task is finished.
3. Blocking in nature.
4. Poor responsiveness if there are multiple CPU intensive operations/tasks involved.

**Asynchronous Programming**

1. Multiple tasks can be executed in parallel as per the thread availability.
2. Tasks can run independently of each other. They are not dependent on any other task.
3. Non-blocking in nature.
4. Better responsiveness compared to Synchronous execution.
