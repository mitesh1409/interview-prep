# What is the difference between Runtime Environment and Framework?

**Runtime Environment**  
It provides the necessary infrastructure for "code execution",  
including services like memory management, I/O operations etc.

Some examples are:  

| Programming Language | Runtime Environment |
| :--- | :--- |
| JavaScript | Node.js |
| Java | JVM |
| Python | CPython |

**Framework**  
Framework is well written, well architected set of tools and libraries of code  
that helps developers to simplify the development process.  

The main purpose/goal of a framework is to provide a good development platform  
to developers so that they focus on writing application code that delievers  
business value.

Some examples are:

| Programming Language | Runtime Environment |
| :--- | :--- |
| JavaScript | [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) |
| Java | [spring](https://spring.io/) |
| Python | [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) |
