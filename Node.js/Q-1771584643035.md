# What is Multi Threaded programming?

We have more than one threads available for execution of our program.  
Using multiple threads we can execute our program asynchronously.  
We can run multiple tasks in parallel.  

It can cause a "Deadlock" if multi threading not implemented correctly.  
It is developer's responsibility to manage threads properly.  
Suitable for CPU intensive applications.  

C, C++, Java etc. are Multi Threaded programming languages.
