# What is Synchronous programming?

Synchronous means line by line in an order (top to bottom).
JavaScript is a Synchronous programming language,  
it means it executes code line by line in an order (top to bottom).

Cons:
- Takes more time when multiple long running tasks are there. The last one will have to wait more.
- It can block the main thread if we are doing time taking operation synchronously.

In a synchronous program, each task is performed one after the other,  
and the program waits for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.

Synchronous programming focuses on the order of execution in a sequential manner,  
while single threaded programming focuses on the single thread.

Synchronous means line by line in an order (top to bottom).
Single Threaded means JavaScript can execute only one command at a time.

Synchronous Single Threaded means JavaScript can execute only one command at a time and
in a specific order (means it can go to the next line once the current line finishes its execution).
