# What are the main features and advantages of Node.js?

| Features | Advantages |
| :--- | :--- |
| Asynchronous | Enables handling multiple concurrent requests & non-blocking execution of thread. |
| V8 JavaScript Engine | The most efficient JavaScript engine, faster code execution. |
| Event-Driven Architecture | Efficient event handling. Great for building real-time apps like chat, gaming where bidirectional communication is required (using websockets). |
| Cross Platform | Supports deployment on various platforms like Linux, Windows, Mac etc. |
| JavaScript on Server Side | No need to learn new language. |

Because of Asynchronous Event-Driven Architecture, Node.js is suitable for building scalable applications that can handle increased loads.
