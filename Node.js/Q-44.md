# What is the Microservices Architecture, and how can we use Node.js to build it?

Microservices Architecture is a design pattern that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs, typically over HTTP/REST or messaging protocols.

Node.js is well-suited for building microservices due to its lightweight nature, non-blocking I/O model, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
