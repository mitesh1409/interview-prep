# What are the differences between Client-Side (Browser) and Server-Side (Node.js)?

**Client-Side vs Server-Side**  

|  | Client-Side/Browser | Server-Side/Node.js |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Where it runs? | User's Web Browser | On the Server |
| Programming Languages | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | JavaScript, Python or Java |
| Document/Window/Navigator/Event Objects | Present | NA |
| Request/Response/Process/Server/Database Objects | NA | Present |
| Responsibilities | Handles UI/UX, Presentation, Client-Side Logic etc. | Handles Business Logic, Authentication, Authorization, Data Access, Data Storage, Server-Side Logic etc. |

**Difference between Node.js & Browser**  
Browser specific objects are not available inside Node.js.
For example "window" object is available in Browser but not in Node.js.

Vice versa
Node.js specific objects won't be available inside Browser.
For example "process" object is available in Node.js but not in Browser.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime.
It does not contain browser specific objects like "window", "document" etc.

| Node.js | Browser |
| :--- | :--- |
| global | window |
| process | document |
| module | history |
| __filename | location |
| require() | navigator |

**Browser Objects**  

* [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)
  A global variable, `window`, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.

* [document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/document)
  `window.document` returns a reference to the document contained in the window.

* [history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/history)
  The `Window.history` read-only property returns a reference to the `History` object, which provides an interface for manipulating the browser session history (pages visited in the tab or frame that the current page is loaded in).

* [location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location)
  The read-only `location` property of the `Window` interface returns a `Location` object with information about the current location of the document.

* [navigator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/navigator)
  The `Window.navigator` read-only property returns a reference to the `Navigator` object, which has methods and properties about the application running the script.

These objects/features are available in Browser environment only, they are not available in Node.js.

**Node.js Objects**  

* [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
  The HTTP interfaces in Node.js are designed to support many features of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use. In particular, large, possibly chunk-encoded, messages. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses, so the user is able to stream data.

* [https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html)
  HTTPS is the HTTP protocol over TLS/SSL. In Node.js this is implemented as a separate module.

* [process](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html)
  The process object provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.

* [os](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html)
  The node:os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

* [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)
  The node:fs module enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.

This modules/objects are available in Node.js only, they are not there in the Browser.
