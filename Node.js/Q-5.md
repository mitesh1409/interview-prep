# What are the differences between Client-Side (Browser) and Server-Side (Node.js)?

**Client-Side vs Server-Side**  

|  | Client-Side/Browser | Server-Side/Node.js |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Where it runs? | User's Web Browser | On the Server |
| Programming Languages | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | JavaScript, Python or Java |
| Document/Window/Navigator/Event Objects | Present | NA |
| Request/Response/Process/Server/Database Objects | NA | Present |
| Responsibilities | Handles UI/UX, Presentation, Client side logic | Handles business logic, authentication, authorization, data access, data storage etc. |

**Difference between Node.js & Browser**  
Browser specific objects are not available inside Node.js.
For example "window" object is available in Browser but not in Node.js.

Vice versa
Node.js specific objects won't be available inside Browser.
For example "process" object is available in Node.js but not in Browser.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime.
It does not contain browser specific objects like "window", "document" etc.

| Node.js | Browser |
| :--- | :--- |
| global | window |
| process | document |
| module | history |
| __filename | location |
| require() | navigator |
