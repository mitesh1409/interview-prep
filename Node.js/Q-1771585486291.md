# How does Node.js handles asynchronous operations?

Node.js handles asynchronous operations using:  

* Callbacks: A function is passed as an argument, and it will execute once the task is completed or event occurs
* Promises: A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future - either a resolved value, or a reason that it is not resolved (rejected).
* Async/Await: Syntactic sugar over promises for better readability.
