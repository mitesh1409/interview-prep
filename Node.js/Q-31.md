# What happens if an unhandled promise rejection occurs?

```javascript

process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
    console.log('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
    // Application specific logging, throwing an error, or other logic here
});

```

This Global event listener will catch any unhandled promise rejections in your Node.js application.  
When a promise is rejected and there is no `.catch()` handler to handle the rejection,  
the `unhandledRejection` event is emitted on the `process` object.
