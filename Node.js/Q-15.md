# What are the disadvantages of Node.js? When to use and when not to use Node.js?

## What Is Node.js Best At?

**Node.js is best at creating Web Servers**  

Node.js works really well when your main performance problem is input/output rather than heavy calculations.  
If our code blocks the JavaScript or uses CPU heavily then our Event Loop will get stuck,  
and then Node.js won't be able to manage the other tasks happening side by side efficiently.  
On the other hand Node.js is really good at serving data for I/O heavy applications.

Node.js is not good at

- audio/video processing
- machine learning
- CPU intensive operations

## When to use Node.js?

* Ideal for **real-time applications** like chat, gaming, collaborative tools  
  because of its Event-Driven architecture.
* Excellent for building **lightweight and scalable RESTful APIs** that handle  
  a large number of concurrent connections.
* Well suited for building **microservices-based architectures**,  
  enabling modular and scalable systems.

## When not to use Node.js?

**CPU-Intensive tasks:**  
Node.js is not suitable for CPU-Intensive tasks like -  
audio/video/image processing, heavy data processing (like encryption/decryption) etc.  
The reason - it will block the main thread (or ultimately Event Loop) and so the app will become unresponsive.  
For such applications Java, Python, C, C++ etc. are preferred.
