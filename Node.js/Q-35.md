# What is Buffer in Node.js?

In Node.js, a Buffer is a global object that provides a way to work with binary data directly.  
Buffers are used to handle raw binary data, such as reading from files or network streams.

Buffers are instances of the `Buffer` class, which is a subclass of JavaScript's `Uint8Array`.

Buffers are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate binary data, such as when dealing with file I/O, network protocols, or cryptographic operations.

Here is an example of how to create and use a Buffer in Node.js:

```javascript
// Creating a Buffer from a string
const buf1 = Buffer.from('Hello, World!', 'utf8');
console.log(buf1); // Output: <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21>
console.log(buf1.toString()); // Output: Hello, World!

// Creating a Buffer of a specific size
const buf2 = Buffer.alloc(10); // Allocates a buffer of 10 bytes
console.log(buf2); // Output: <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>
// Writing data to a Buffer
buf2.write('Node.js');
console.log(buf2.toString()); // Output: Node.js
```

Buffers in Node.js are essential for handling binary data efficiently and are widely used in various applications, including file operations, network communication, and data processing.
