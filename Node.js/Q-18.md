# What is module wrapper function?

The module wrapper function in Node.js is an invisible function that encapsulates the code of each module before it is executed. Node.js does not directly run the code within a module file; instead, it wraps it within a function with a specific signature. This wrapper function provides a crucial mechanism for modularity and isolation within the Node.js environment.  

The structure of the module wrapper function:  

```JavaScript
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // Your module code goes here
});
```

This wrapper function serves several key purposes:  

* Module Scope: It keeps top-level variables (declared with var, const, or let) and functions defined within a module private and scoped to that specific module, preventing them from polluting the global scope.

* Providing Module-Specific Variables: It injects several "global-looking" variables that are actually local to each module:  
  * exports: An object used to expose functions or variables from the module to other modules.
  * require: A function used to import other modules into the current module.
  * module: An object representing the current module, with module.exports being the primary way to export values.
  * __filename: The absolute file path of the current module.
  * __dirname: The directory name of the current module.

* Encapsulation and Isolation: By wrapping each module's code, Node.js ensures that modules operate independently and do not inadvertently interfere with each other's variables or functions. This promotes cleaner code organization and reduces the risk of naming conflicts.
