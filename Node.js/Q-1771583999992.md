# Node.js Vs JavaScript

**JavaScript**  
JavaScript is a single threaded programming language.  
To execute JavaScript we need a JavaScript Runtime Environment.

| JavaScript Runtime Environment | Where it executes the JavaScript? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Browsers | Client Side (User's machine) |
| Node.js | Server |
| Bun | Server |
| Deno | Server |

**Node.js**  
Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime Environment that allows us to run JavaScript outside of a Browser.  
Using Node.js we can write server applications using JavaScript.
