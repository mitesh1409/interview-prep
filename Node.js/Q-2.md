# How Node.js is a Runtime Environment on the server side? What is V8?

To execute JavaScript we need a JavaScript engine.
Each browser has its own JavaScript engine.

| Browser | JavaScript Engine |
| :--- | :--- |
| Chrome | V8 |
| Mozilla | SpiderMonkey |
| Safari | JavaScriptCore/Nitro |

So V8 is the JavaScript Engine developed by Google for Chrome browser.

Browser executes JavaScript code on Client-Side using JavaScript Engine.

Similarly, Node.js uses V8 to execute JavaScript.

Node.js = V8 + libuv
Node.js is made up of - V8 JavaScript Engine + libuv

That way Node.js can execute JavaScript on Server-Side.
