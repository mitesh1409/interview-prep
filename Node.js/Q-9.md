# What is Single Threaded programming?

In a Single Threaded programming language,  
we have only one thread available for execution.

Since we have a single thread it can execute only one thing at a time.

For example,
Client makes a request to the Server,  
lets say client is requesting for a quarterly report from the server.  
For this request server may need to do multiple tasks,  
say for example server need to do 5 different tasks.  
Now since we have a single thread it will execute one task at a time,  
so order of execution will be task 1 -> task 2 ... -> task 5.  

Using Single Thread we can do Synchronous and Asynchronous programming.  
Node.js does that with the help of "Event Loop".

Synchronous means line by line in an order (top to bottom).
Single Threaded means JavaScript can execute only one command at a time.

Synchronous Single Threaded means JavaScript can execute only one command at a time and
in a specific order (means it can go to the next line once the current line finishes its execution).
