# Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication => verifies the identity  
Authorization => verifies the capabilities  

## 🔑 Authentication (AuthN)

* **Definition:** The process of **verifying the identity** of a user, service, or device.
* **Question Asked:** **"Who are you?"**
* **Analogy:** Showing your **ID** at a checkpoint.
* **Goal:** To confirm that the user claiming to be $X$ is indeed $X$.

## 🛡️ Authorization (AuthZ)

* **Definition:** The process of **verifying the capabilities** (or permissions) that a successfully authenticated user has to access a specific resource or perform a specific action.
* **Question Asked:** **"What are you allowed to do?"**
* **Analogy:** The **key card or badge** you receive, which only grants access to certain rooms.
* **Goal:** To determine if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions.

## 🏢 Real-World Example: A Banking Website

Let's use a hypothetical banking application as an example to illustrate both steps:

### 1. Authentication (Who are you?)

1. A customer, **Alice**, goes to the banking website and enters her **username** and **password**.
2. The system checks these credentials against its database.
3. If the credentials match, the system confirms: **"This is Alice."**
4. **Result:** Alice is now **logged in**. The Authentication step is complete.

### 2. Authorization (What are you allowed to do?)

Now that Alice is logged in, she tries to perform several actions:

| Action Attempted | Authorization Check | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **View her account balance** | Does a standard customer role have permission to view their own balance? | **Yes.** Access Granted. |
| **Transfer money** | Does a standard customer role have permission to initiate transfers? | **Yes.** Access Granted. |
| **Approve a $1,000,000 loan** | Does Alice's customer role have the permission to approve loans of this magnitude? | **No.** Access Denied. (Only a manager or loan officer would have this authorization.) |
| **View another customer's SSN/Tax ID** | Does a customer role have permission to access another customer's sensitive data? | **No.** Access Denied. |

### Summary of the Example

* **Authentication** is checking Alice's login credentials to let her *into* the bank.
* **Authorization** is checking Alice's defined permissions (her "role") to see which specific services she can use once she's *inside*.
