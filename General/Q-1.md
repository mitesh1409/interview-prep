# S in SOLID Principles - SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that there should never be more than one reason for a class to change.  
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.  

Seperation of Concerns is there.

Another wording for the Single Responsibility Principle is:  
Gather together the things that change for the same reasons.  
Separate those things that change for different reasons.  

Importance:  

* Maintainability: When classes have a single, well-defined responsibility, they're easier to understand and modify.
* Testability: It's easier to write unit tests for classes with a single focus.
* Flexibility: Changes to one responsibility don't affect unrelated parts of the system.
