# D in SOLID Principles - DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states to depend upon abstractions, not concretes.

The principle states:  

High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
By dictating that both high-level and low-level objects must depend on the same abstraction, this design principle inverts the way some people may think about object-oriented programming.

Importance:  

* Loose coupling: Reduces dependencies between modules, making the code more flexible and easier to test.
* Flexibility: Enables changes to implementations without affecting clients.
* Maintainability: Makes code easier to understand and modify.
