# Write a query

Write a single query to update user status such that active users become inactive  
and inactive users become active OR say toggling the user's active status (active => inactive, inactive => active).

Assume the following table for the users:  

users  
id, name, gender, active, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at  
11, 'Mitesh Prajapati', 'Male', 1, ...  
12, 'Kaushal Hirani', 'Male', 0, ...  
13, 'Siddhraj Chauhan', 'Male', 0, ...  
14, 'Gautam Patel', 'Male', 1, ...  

Using MySQL `IF` function:  

```sql
UPDATE users
SET active = IF(active = 1, 0, 1);
```

OR  

Toggles boolean/bit value:  

```sql
UPDATE users
SET active = NOT active;
```

OR  

Arithmetic Toggle method (less readable)  

```sql
UPDATE users
SET active = 1 - active;
```
